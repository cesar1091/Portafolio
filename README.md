Hi, this is my portfolio and personal blog, occasionally I will post about topics that I studied in my MIT micromaster in my own way with examples and tips to apply this knowledge in a correct way.

Another think that I'll post in few months is about data engineering, because I'll take a program in cloud computing in the AWS, Google, Azure platform to deploy different solutions like data lakes, data warehousing and metadata to manteain a level of quality in the data.

Eventually, I'll post about data governance and the best practice with the help of DAMA DMBOK to have a control and security in the information of your organization.

Thanks!!!!
